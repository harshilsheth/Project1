Project that illustrates use of D3.JS Library.
D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library that uses digital data to drive the creation 
and control of dynamic and interactive graphical forms which run in web browsers. 
It is a tool for data visualization in W3C-compliant computing, making use of the widely implemented
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), JavaScript, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) standards.
For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, 
use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.
In this Coding contest, we have taken a dataset (cereal dataset) of our interest and 
visualized it using D3.We have modified the existing bar graphs example according to our requirement.
This visualization is interactive and very helpful to the users who wish to buy a cereal depending on particular 
attributes like calories, protein, fats etc.
